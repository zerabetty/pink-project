          Our Story
        </h1>

        <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-4">
          We are <strong>Eylül Polat</strong> and{" "}
          <strong>Zehra Betül Arslantaş</strong>, two Software Engineering
          students at Istinye University. In our journey on technology in these
          past 4 years, we were passionate, determined, and always wanted to do
          something that can impact the lives of others, especially women. So
          when we were deciding on a capstone project, we knew we wanted to do
          something that we both care about and hold close to our hearts: breast
          cancer awareness.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-4">
          So out of all the topics that matter to people, particularly women,
          why did we choose breast cancer? Growing up, we hear stories from all
          around us as women. Stories of strength, bravery, determination. But
          we also hear unfortunate stories of health issues putting these
          amazing feelings into test. One of these issues is breast cancer, and
          we strongly believe that no one should go without the help that they
          need, that all women should have access to knowledge about this issue,
          and have a supportive circle that is going to help them through this
          hard time.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-4">
          For us, this project is more than a capstone project, it is an honest
          and heartfelt attempt to raise awareness for breast cancer and provide
          emotional support to women all around the world who may or may not be
          affected by this issue.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-4">
          This project has a special significance for us as we are reaching the
          end of our time at Istinye University. “The Pink Space” is a project
          that lets us combine our knowledge, technical expertise and passion
          with a topic that is important to us and also affects women all around
          the world. With offering emotional support, we hope to improve the
          lives of people that are impacted by breast cancer.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-6">
          The goal of this project is to create something where people can
          benefit from, get emotional support and learn more about breast
          cancer. Our aim with this platform is it being more than a tool; but
          to be a source of connection, strength, and a sense of unity for
          people, especially women from all around the world.
        </p>
