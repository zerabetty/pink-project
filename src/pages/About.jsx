      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      We are Eyl√ºl Polat and Zehra Bet√ºl Arslanta≈ü, two Software Engineering students at Istinye University. 
      In our journey on technology in these past 4 years, we were passionate, determined, and always wanted to do something that can impact the lives of others, especially women.
      So when we were deciding on a capstone project, we knew we wanted to do something that we both care about and hold close to our hearts: breast cancer awareness. 
      We knew that we can use our knowledge and abilities that we developed in these past 4 years into the greater good of other people, especially women with our project, ‚ÄúThe Pink Space‚Äù.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      So out of all the topics that matter to people, particularly women, why did we choose breast cancer? 
      Growing up, we hear stories from all around us as women. Stories of strength, bravery, determination. 
      But we also hear unfortunate stories of health issues putting these amazing feelings into test. 
      One of these issues is breast cancer, and we strongly believe that no one should go without the help that they need,
      that all women should have access to knowledge about this issue, and have a supportive circle that is going to help them through this hard time. 
      For us, this project is more than a capstone project, it is an honest and heartfelt attempt to raise awareness 
      for breast cancer and provide emotional support to women all around the world who may or may not be affected by this issue. 
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      This project has a special significance for us as we are reaching the end of our time at Istinye University. 
      ‚ÄúThe Pink Space‚Äù is a project that lets us combine our knowledge, technical expertise and passion with a 
      topic that is important to us and also affects women all around the world. With offering emotional support,
      we hope to improve the lives of people that are impacted by breast cancer. The goal of this project is to
      create something where people can benefit from, get emotional support and learn more about breast cancer. 
      Our aim with this platform is it being more than a tool; but to be a source of connection, strength, and a sense 
      of unity for people, especially women from all around the world.
      </p>
